# Artificial intelligence (OPA23GB_AI2)

In this course, you'll dive into the concepts of AI to develop and use algorithms to solve real world problems. The course starts off with classical machine learning which are based on statistical methods, covering topics such as regression, classifications, supervised and unsupervised learning, evaluation, then moving towards artificial neural networks, deep learning and finally generative models. Throughout the journey you will get to work with tabular data, recommendation systems, computer vision, large language models and creating dashboards for end users to enjoy.

Before this course, it's important that you have knowledge covered in [OPA23GB_AI 1](https://github.com/AIgineerAB/data_processing_HA24), which covers

- fundamental python
- data processing with pandas
- data visualisation and storytelling
- git and github

Note that linear algebra and basic statistics are good to have, but not mandatory, as a lot of formal mathematics will be abstracted away. We will instead focus on understanding the concepts and implementing them in code to solve real world problems.
