# Week 12 - Resources

Note that the resource material is very extensive and you are not required to read them all. See it as a reference material, which you always can come back to. 

This week is mostly a continuation on the previous course, and will cover the parts that haven't been covered yet. Also there will be an introduction to AI in this week. 

## Setup :wrench:

1. Create a new repository on Github for this course and clone the repository
2. In your local repository, create a virtual environment using venv 
   
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate your venv 
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate # mac
   source venv/Scripts/activate # windows with git bash
   ```
4. Install packages to your virtual environment
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn ipykernel scikit-learn
   ```
